I participated in the [**CS 506 Fall 2025 Technical Midterm**](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cs-506-fall-2025-technical-midterm) Kaggle competition and ranked **15th on the public leaderboard** and **16th on the private leaderboard**.

The project repository is available here:

This experience helped me strengthen my applied data science and feature engineering skills using real-world datasets.
