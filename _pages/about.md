I am a Master’s student in the Artificial Intelligence program at Boston University, specializing in machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. My research focuses on developing explainable and socially responsible AI systems that bridge technology and human impact.

My recent work spans vision-language modeling, hate-speech detection, and public-transit equity analysis, where I integrate deep learning with real-world data for social good. I have co-authored research presented at DravidianLangTech-EACL 2024, and continue exploring multilingual and low-resource NLP challenges.

Before joining Boston University, I earned my B.Tech in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence from IIIT Dharwad, where I led multiple applied research projects and trained peers in AI and Flutter development. Beyond academics, I enjoy mentoring, contributing to open-source initiatives, and building systems that make AI more transparent and inclusive.
