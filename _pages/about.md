Hi! I’m **Srinivasa Sai Chava** (Sai). I’m a graduate student in BU’s MSAI program.
My interests span **ML systems**, **vision–language**, and **responsible NLP**.

- currently: projects on MBTA service equity, explainable hate-speech detection, and vision-language segmentation
- previously: ML + Flutter trainer @ Datavalley.ai; led Indian-language MT evaluation at IIIT Dharwad
- tools i use a lot: Python, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Hugging Face, Docker, Git, AWS/Azure

If you’re hiring for summer 2026 internships or research, I’d love to chat.
