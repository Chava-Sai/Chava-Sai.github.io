I am a Master’s student in Artificial Intelligence at Boston University, where I am specializing in machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. My academic and research interests focus on developing explainable, socially responsible, and trustworthy AI systems that connect algorithmic innovation with real-world societal impact. I am passionate about leveraging data-driven approaches to address challenges in multilingual understanding, digital equity, and information reliability.

My current work explores vision–language modeling, hate-speech detection, and public-transit equity analytics, integrating deep learning with large-scale public data to promote fairness and transparency in AI-enabled decision systems. I co-authored research presented at DravidianLangTech-EACL 2024, focusing on multilingual and code-mixed language processing for low-resource Indian languages. I also contribute to ongoing projects in explainable generative AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for grounded reasoning in social media text classification.

Before joining Boston University, I earned my Bachelor of Technology in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence from the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Dharwad, where I led several research and application-oriented projects under the guidance of Dr. Sunil Saumya and Dr. Shankar Biradar. My undergraduate work spanned fake-news detection, machine translation, and healthcare informatics, emphasizing both model interpretability and societal benefit. In parallel, I served as a Machine Learning and Flutter Trainer at Datavalley.ai, mentoring students across multiple institutions and guiding full-stack AI app deployments.

Beyond my formal studies, I am deeply involved in mentoring, open-source development, and cross-disciplinary collaboration. I enjoy building tools that make AI more inclusive, transparent, and accessible to under-represented communities. I aspire to contribute to research that advances multilingual AI, explainable deep learning, and equitable data systems—pushing the boundaries of how artificial intelligence can responsibly enhance everyday human life.
